# TestTensorFlowMobileWithSwift

## Sample project to test Tensorflow Mobile with UIKit and AVFoundation related code re-written in Swift.

This is based on:

   https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/ios
   
provided as example on how to run Inception model on iOS to do Image recognition. Here, I have combined the /simple and /camara into a single test project.

Tested on Xcode 9.0 

1) Clone the project
2) % cd TestTensorFlowMobileWithSwift
3) % pod install
4) % open TestTensorFlowMobileWithSwift.xcworkspace

If you are not able to run, please post them on Issues.
